# Xmas Lights

Notes for my xmas lights setup. Unlikely to be useful to anyone else, but why not publish it?

Each year is in its own subdirectory. (Some stuff is just copied and yes I could use git tags or something but this is more convenient and this isn't a project where I expect collaboration or maintenance).
